First Project - Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction of financial assets

This is my very first project on GitHub

I want to use Deep Learning methods for times series analysis. The goal is to find the best neural network architecture to predict
future prices of financial assets and investment instruments.

I plan on comparing the following methods:
 - Convolutional NN (in combi with RNNs)
 - more sophisticated RNN architectures such as LSTM or Attention NN
 - reinforcement learning
